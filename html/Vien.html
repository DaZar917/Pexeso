        <h1><span>General information</span></h1>
        <p><span>Vienna</span> (/viˈɛnə/ (About this soundlisten);[9][10] German: Wien [viːn] (About this soundlisten)) <span>is the national capital</span>, largest city, and one of <span>nine states of Austria</span>. Vienna is Austria's most populous city, with about 1.9 million inhabitants[3] (2.6 million within the metropolitan area,[11] nearly one third of the country's population), and its cultural, economic, and political centre. <span>It is the 6th-largest city by population</span> within city limits in the European Union. </p>
        <p>Until the beginning of the 20th century, it was the largest German-speaking city in the world, and before the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I, the city had 2 million inhabitants.[12] Today, it is the second-largest German-speaking city after Berlin.[13][14] Vienna is host to many major international organizations, including the United Nations, OPEC, and the OSCE. <span>The city is located in the eastern part of Austria</span> and is close to the borders of Czechia, Slovakia, and Hungary. These regions work together in a European Centrope border region. Along with nearby Bratislava, Vienna forms a metropolitan region with 3 million inhabitants.<span> In 2001, the city centre was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</span> In July 2017 it was moved to the list of World Heritage in Danger.</p>
        <p>Additionally to being known as the "City of Music"[16] due to its musical legacy, Vienna is also said to be the "City of Dreams", because of it being home to the world's first psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud.[17] Vienna's ancestral roots lie in early Celtic and Roman settlements that transformed into a Medieval and Baroque city. It is well known for having played a pivotal role as a leading European music centre, from the age of Viennese Classicism through the early part of the 20th century. The historic centre of Vienna is rich in architectural ensembles, including Baroque palaces and gardens, and the late-19th-century Ringstraße lined with grand buildings, monuments and parks.[18]</p>
        <p><span>Vienna is known for its high quality of life. In a 2005 study</span>of 127 world cities, the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked the city first (in a tie with Vancouver and San Francisco) for the world's most liveable cities. Between 2011 and 2015, Vienna was ranked second, behind Melbourne.[19][20][21][22][23] In 2018, it replaced Melbourne as the number one spot [24] and continued<span> as the first in 2019</span>.[25] For ten consecutive years (2009–2019), the human-resource-consulting firm Mercer ranked Vienna first in its annual "Quality of Living" survey of hundreds of cities around the world.[26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33] Monocle's 2015 "Quality of Life Survey" ranked Vienna second on a list of the top 25 cities in the world <span>"to make a base within."</span></p>
        <p>The UN-Habitat classified Vienna as the most <span>prosperous city in the world in 2012/2013</span>.[39] The city was ranked 1st globally for its culture of innovation in 2007 and 2008, and sixth globally (out of 256 cities) in the 2014 Innovation Cities Index, which analyzed 162 indicators in covering three areas: culture, infrastructure, and markets.[40][41][42] Vienna regularly hosts urban planning conferences <span>and is often used as a case study by</span> urban planners.[43]</p>
        <p>Between 2005 and 2010, Vienna was the world's number-one destination for international congresses and conventions.[44] It attracts over 6.8 million tourists a year.[45]</p>

        <h2>Travel to the Dubai</h2>
        <p>Dubai is the most populous city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the capital of the Emirate of Dubai. Located in the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula on the coast of the Persian Gulf, Dubai aims to be the business hub of Western Asia. It is also a major global transport hub for passengers and cargo. Oil revenue helped accelerate the development of the city, which was already a major mercantile hub. Today, less than 5% of the emirate's revenue comes from oil. A centre for regional and international trade since the early 20th century, Dubai's economy relies on revenues from trade, tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial services.</p>

        <p>The beach is a relatively flat surface of any water body formed by its erosion under the action of water and wind. As this place is very attractive for recreational purposes, the term "beach" is used as a place for mass relaxation, bathing and sunbathing. Such a beach is provided with appropriate equipment (deck chairs, umbrellas, cabins and toilets), resulting in a beach called "cultural", unlike the beach "wild", on which nature to some extent retains its original appearance, and people feel more free. The beaches are divided into sandy, sandy with shells and pebbles.</p>
